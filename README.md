ðŸ”¥ Project SARKARISATHI


âœ… Team Name
CODE CRAFTERS 

âœ… Problem Statement Name
SB-01: Ai-Powered Chatbot for Government Schemes and financial aid

âœ… Project Title (if any)
BOLT â€” SarkariSathi

âœ… Brief Project Description
SarkariSathi is an intelligent monitoring system designed for bridges and similar public infrastructure. Using a network of IoT sensors, the system continuously tracks vibration, load, temperature, and potential structural anomalies. Data is processed using AI models to predict failures and send alerts in real-time. This solution aims to enhance safety, reduce maintenance costs, and provide timely alerts to authorities.

âœ… Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python (Flask)

AI/ML: TensorFlow, scikit-learn

IoT: Raspberry Pi, Accelerometer (ADXL345), Vibration Sensors

Database: Firebase Realtime DB

Visualization: Chart.js
